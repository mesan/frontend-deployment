        <h1>Simple static site</h1>
        <p>This is a simple static site. It can be hosted on a static webserver on your own private server, requiring almost no configuration. You could be live in less than five minutes!</p>
        <p>
            To get this live in the simplest way, all you need is the following:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Have access and sudo privileges to a server with Apache installed. If it's not installed, install it. If this is the first website hosted with Apache, you will probably need to run the following command:
                    <ul><li>sudo a2dissite *default</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>Create a directory somewhere to contain your website, and put your files in there (at minimum an index.html).</li>
                <li>Add a config file for your site, such as <a href="apache-sitename.conf">this one</a>, and place it in /etc/apache2/sites-available. Simply replace the relevant fields to point to your domain and the folder containing your site. The filename should match the domain.</li>
                <li>
                    Run the following commands, replacing example.com with your domain:
                    <ul>
                        <li>sudo a2ensite example.com.conf</li>
                        <li>sudo service apache2 restart</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Your site should now be live!</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
